# Exploratory Data Analysis on USSeatBelts Dataset

**Roll No.: 21BDS0193**  
**Course:** BCSE331L - Exploratory Data Analysis  
**Assessment:** Digital Assessment I (CO5 BL5)

## Overview

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook (`21BDS0193.ipynb`) that performs an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the USSeatBelts dataset. The project includes:

- **Data Loading:** Importing the dataset from the provided URL.
- **Data Inspection:** Analyzing dimensions, summary statistics, and basic information.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and ensuring data quality.
- **Univariate Analysis:** Visualizing distributions and frequency counts.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Examining relationships using pairplots and correlation heatmaps.
- **Multivariate Analysis:** Advanced visualizations including PairGrid and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

This analysis is aligned with the topics covered from Module 2 to Module 7.

## Dataset

The dataset is loaded from the following URL:  
[USSeatBelts Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salemprakash/EDA/main/Data/USSeatBelts.csv)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed in your environment:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

If using Google Colab, these libraries are pre-installed. For local development, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Running the Notebook

1. **Open the Notebook:**
   - If using Google Colab, click on [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and then open the notebook from your GitHub repository.
   - Alternatively, download the notebook and open it locally with Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Execute the Cells:**
   - Run all cells sequentially to perform the entire EDA process.
   - Review the outputs and visualizations to understand the data insights.
